# lnt-ext
A quick extension for fixing lightnoveltranslations issue with the table of contents / word press errors.

This just adds a `lnt-ext-bypass=1` query parameter to all links and pages on light novel translations.

## Usage
I'm not going to turn this into a proper extension as that sounds like a lot of work, but if you still want to install it, you can load it unpacked.

To install this, you can:
1) Download the contents of this repo: [here](https://github.com/cardboards-box/lnt-ext/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or click the "Code" drop down on the main page and click "Download Zip".
2) Unzip the code someone on your computer (I'd suggest putting it in a folder you create called "lnt-ext" or something)
3) On a chromium based browser (chrome, opera, edge, etc) go to one of the following (copy and paste into your browser):
    - Opera: `opera://extensions`
    - Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
    - Microsoft Edge: `edge://extensions`
4) Find the "Load Unpacked" button (you might need to enable developer mode to see it)
5) Select the folder you made in step #2
6) Refresh any lightnovelstranslations.com pages and it should add the parameter
7) Enjoy reading
